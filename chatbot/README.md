### Service Dependencies

- egov-apportion-service
- egov-user : All the users interacting through chatbot will be stored in the egov-user service. Chatbot does not store any user information such as mobile number.
- egov-localization : The chatbot is made such that it will store localization codes and the actual text value will be fetched only at the end. This way we can provide multi-lingual support. Localization service is also used to construct messages from templates. This dependency can be eliminated if you want to pass values instead of localization codes.
- egov-filestore : It is a dependency if you want to send/receive any file. This includes sending PDF/Image files.
