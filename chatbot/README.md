### Service Dependencies

- egov-user-chatbot : For creating user without name validation and logging in user
- egov-user : For searching user
- egov-localization : The chatbot is made such that it will store localization codes and the actual text value will be fetched only at the end. This way we can provide multi-lingual support. Localization service is also used to construct messages from templates. This dependency can be eliminated if you want to pass values instead of localization codes.
- egov-filestore : It is a dependency if you want to send/receive any file. This includes sending PDF/Image files.
- egov-url-shortening : For shorting links sent to the user
- egov-mdms-service : For loading mdms data
